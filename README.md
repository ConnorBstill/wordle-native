# Project goals

I originally started this project in order to familiarize myself with hooks after only having worked on React and React Native projects that were still using class components.

In addition to learning hooks, I also wanted to refresh my knowledge of Redux, without knowing at the time that there are better alternatives to Redux (Zustand, Jotai). Redux was definitley not necessary for this project, especially considering its size, so I plan on replacing it with something more lightweight soon (or just restructuring the app to not need global state management at all since it's just one screen and a modal).
